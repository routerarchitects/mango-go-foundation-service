# Mango Cloud Go Foundation Service

A standardized, production-ready microservice foundation skeleton for the Mango Cloud (OpenWiFi) environment. This service provides a pre-configured architecture featuring dual-port HTTP server separation, PostgreSQL integration, automated schema migrations, and Service Discovery out-of-the-box.

## Scaffolding a New Service

To instantiate a new service using this foundation template:

1. Execute the `init-service.sh` script, providing your new service name, public API port, private API port, and target directory:
   ```bash
   ./init-service.sh <new-service-name> <public-port> <private-port> [target-directory]
   ```

2. **Example**:
   ```bash
   ./init-service.sh mango-go-foundation-service 16012 17012 ../mango-go-foundation-service
   ```

3. Navigate to the generated directory and start customizing.

## Local Development (Outside Docker)

### Prerequisites
* Go 1.25+ installed
* PostgreSQL and Kafka running (or forwarded to `localhost`)

### Steps
1. Start the service locally:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   *(Note: The Makefile will automatically generate self-signed TLS certificates under `./certs/` if they do not exist).*

2. Alternatively, you can run it manually:
   ```bash
   # Make sure self-signed certs exist first
   make certs
   # Run with sourced configurations
   source configs/local-dev.env && go run ./cmd
   ```

---

## Docker Integration

### 1. Build the Image
```bash
make docker-build
```

### 2. Integrate with Mango Cloud Compose Stack
1. When you run `./init-service.sh`, prompt for the path of your `docker-compose` directory. The script will automatically copy the generated `.env` configuration file to that directory.

2. Alternatively, copy it manually:
   ```bash
   cp deployments/docker-compose/<your-service-name>.env /path_to/mango-cloud-deployment/docker-compose/
   ```

3. Paste the service block displayed on the screen (or from `deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml`) inside the `services:` block of your deployment's `docker-compose.yml`.

4. Re-launch the compose deployment:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build <your-service-name>
   ```

## Database Migrations
Migrations are managed dynamically. When the service boots up:
1. It validates the database connection.
2. It verifies the presence of the `schema_migrations` tracking table.
3. It scans the `db/schema/` directory for `.sql` files.
4. Any SQL files that have not been registered are executed sequentially in individual SQL transactions.
5. If a migration fails, the transaction is rolled back and the service blocks startup to prevent running on a broken schema.
